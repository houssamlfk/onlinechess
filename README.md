# onlinechess
A desktop application style chess game that supports offline mode, versus AI, and also versus other players in online mode!
This project has been made using a JavaFX frontend, coupled with a SpringBoot backend that uses PostgreSQL as database. This project's online version is still designed to work on localhost since it's server is not hosted on any domain.
Enjoy playing the game!
